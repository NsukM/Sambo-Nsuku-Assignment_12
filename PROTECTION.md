## Protected Branch: main

To ensure high-quality code and enforce a professional workflow, the following branch protection rules are applied:

- ✅ Pull request reviews required
- ✅ Status checks must pass (CI tests)
- ✅ Direct pushes to main are blocked
- ✅ Require linear history (optional)
- ✅ Include administrators (optional, but enabled for consistency)

These rules ensure that only tested, reviewed, and approved code reaches production.
